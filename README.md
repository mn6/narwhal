# üõëüêã Narwhal
Narwhal is a Chrome extension for skipping recipe blog stories and bypassing website paywalls. It adds a "skip to recipe" button on most recipe blogs that use common recipe modules and removes paywalls on news websites automatically.

## Installation

1. Click the "Clone or Download" dropdown above and then "Download ZIP".
2. Move the `narwhal-master` folder from the ZIP to wherever you'd like.
3. Type `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar.
4. Check "Developer Mode" at the top right of the page.
5. Click "Load Unpacked" on the top left and open the `narwhal-master` folder.
